# Thread Safety Issues in cp2077-coop

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Global Network State (src/net/Net.cpp)
**Severity: HIGH**

The following global variables are accessed from multiple threads without synchronization:
- `g_Host` (ENetHost*)
- `g_Peers` (std::vector<PeerEntry>)
- `g_nextPeerId` (uint32_t)

**Functions affected:** Net_Poll, Net_Connect, Net_Disconnect, Net_IsConnected, Net_GetPeers, Net_Send, Net_Broadcast, and many others.

**Impact:** Race conditions can cause:
- Memory corruption in peer vector operations
- Inconsistent peer ID assignment
- Crashes during concurrent network operations

**Recommended Fix:**
```cpp
// Add mutex protection
std::mutex g_NetMutex;

// Wrap all access in lock guards
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(g_NetMutex);
```

### 2. HTTP Client Async Operations (src/core/HttpClient.cpp)
**Severity: MEDIUM**

Async HTTP operations may have race conditions in the global async result storage.

**Impact:** Potential corruption of HTTP response data between threads.

### 3. Voice Encoder State (src/voice/VoiceEncoder.cpp)
**Severity: MEDIUM**

Voice encoding state may be accessed from multiple threads without proper synchronization.

## Partial Fixes Applied

1. **Added mutex to Net.cpp** - Started implementing thread safety for network globals
2. **Added error handling** - Improved validation to catch race condition side effects

## Remaining Work Required

### Phase 1: Critical Network Thread Safety
1. Complete mutex protection for all g_Host, g_Peers, g_nextPeerId access
2. Add timeout protection for network operations
3. Implement proper shutdown synchronization

### Phase 2: HTTP Client Thread Safety
1. Protect async HTTP result storage with mutex
2. Add request timeout and cancellation support
3. Implement connection pooling with thread safety

### Phase 3: Voice System Thread Safety
1. Review voice encoder for race conditions
2. Add proper synchronization for audio buffers
3. Implement thread-safe codec switching

### Phase 4: Game State Synchronization
1. Protect shared game state with reader-writer locks
2. Implement atomic operations for simple state updates
3. Add validation for concurrent state modifications

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate (Critical):** Network state mutex protection
2. **Short term (High):** HTTP client thread safety
3. **Medium term (Medium):** Voice system synchronization
4. **Long term (Low):** Advanced synchronization patterns

## Testing Strategy

1. **Stress Testing:** Run multiple clients connecting/disconnecting rapidly
2. **Race Condition Detection:** Use ThreadSanitizer (TSan) during development
3. **Deadlock Detection:** Monitor for mutex ordering issues
4. **Performance Impact:** Measure synchronization overhead

## Notes

- Current implementation assumes single-threaded access in many places
- ENet library itself has some thread safety considerations
- Game engine callbacks may come from different threads
- REDscript integration needs to consider thread context

## Status

- **Started:** Basic mutex protection for network globals
- **In Progress:** Comprehensive thread safety audit
- **Pending:** Full implementation and testing
